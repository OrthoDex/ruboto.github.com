Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 0.16.0 released!

The Ruboto team is pleased to announce the release of Ruboto 0.16.0.

Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone
apps for Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes
support libraries and generators for creating projects, classes, tests,
and more.  The complete APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby are available to
you using the Ruby language.

New in version 0.16.0:

In this release we add support for Android 4.4 KitKat!  You can also use
git-based gems in your Gemfile.apk, and implement framework methods like
onCreate in a Ruby Module and share them across Ruby classes.  We have
expanded the Android Fragment support to allow the use of the Ruboto
Widget DSL.  On the testing side, "ruboto setup" now downloads and
installs HAXM which gives a 10 times speedup of the emulator!  For early
adopters we now support Ruby 2.1 when using JRuby 9000 builds.
