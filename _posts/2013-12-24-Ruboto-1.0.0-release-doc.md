Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 1.0.0 released!

The Ruboto team is pleased to announce the release of Ruboto 1.0.0.

Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone
apps for Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes
support libraries and generators for creating projects, classes, tests,
and more.  The complete APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby are available to
you using the Ruby language.

New in version 1.0.0:

The main motivation for the 1.0 release is to announce that Ruboto is
ready for general consumption!

* All important parts of the Android API are available.
* The API has stabilised.
* Performance is reasonable. (Best case startup 4 seconds or less).
* Home page/Wiki/Tutorials and other docs are of high enough quality that
new developers have a low threshold to get going, and more advanced
developers can find how to do more advanced apps.

Notable features this release is RubyGems support for the "dalvik"
platform and support for using Android utility projects.  This means you
can release gems for dalvik only and consume in-house or third-party
utility projects.

* Issue #524 Use "ruboto emulator" to setup HAXM
