Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 1.0.3 released!

The Ruboto team is pleased to announce the release of Ruboto 1.0.3.

Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone
apps for Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes
support libraries and generators for creating projects, classes, tests,
and more.  The complete APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby are available to
you using the Ruby language.

New in version 1.0.3:

This release focuses on stability and introduces a new mechanism for
reducing the footprint of your app using the ruboto.yml config file.  You
can now specify the Ruby compatibility level of your app (1.8/1.9/2.0) and
which parts of the Ruby Standard Library you want to use.  Ruboto will now
strip the parts you don't need, making your app a bit smaller.
