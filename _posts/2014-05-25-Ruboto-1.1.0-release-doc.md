Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 1.1.0 released!

The Ruboto team is pleased to announce the release of Ruboto 1.1.0.

Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone
apps for Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes
support libraries and generators for creating projects, classes, tests,
and more.  The complete APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby are available to
you using the Ruby language.

New in version 1.1.0:

This release adds support for large projects with more than 64K methods
and Ruby stdlib HTTPS/SSL.  HTTPS/SSL using the Android APIs is working as
before.

To use the Ruby stdlib SSL features you need to include JRuby 1.7.13 or
later in your app, and set the Android target to Android 4.1 (api level
android-16) or later.  JRuby 1.7.13 has not been released yet, but you can
use the "jruby-1_7" or "master" branches of JRuby if you want to try it
now.

The large app feature utilises the "multi-dex" option of the Android
tooling, and also requires the target of your project to be set to Android
4.1 (api level android-16) or later.

The SSL feature is still new and will be improved in the coming releases
of Ruboto.  An example is that accessing GitHub by https does not work out
of the box.  This is being tracked as Issue #627 , and we would very much
like contributors on this.

* Issue #154 Add support for SSL
