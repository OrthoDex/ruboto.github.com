Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 1.3.0 released!

The Ruboto team is pleased to announce the release of Ruboto 1.3.0.

Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone
apps for Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes
support libraries and generators for creating projects, classes, tests,
and more.  The complete APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby are available to
you using the Ruby language.

New in version 1.3.0:

It's been a long time since the last release.  We have had some problems
getting the test matrix green at https://travis-ci.org/ruboto/ruboto and
as there are still some combinations failing, we need help to fix them.
If you have experience debugging on Android, please contribute.

In the meantime, we have added support for JRuby up to 1.7.19 and Android
up to 5.1.  There are still some bugs to sort out, but we are getting
there  :)  Testing with JRuby 9000 has begun, but is currently failing.

A new feature is the running of "src/environment.rb" if it is present
right after JRuby initialization.  This enables loading of gems and code
common across activities, broadcast receivers, and services.

Use of Bundler has improved to allow gems that duplicate files in Ruby
Stdlib like JSON, and allow local gems using the "path" option in the
Gemfile.  Support for ActiveRecord has been updated to 4.1.

Finally we have updated the homepage and wiki with a few changes.

Thanks to all who have contributed!
