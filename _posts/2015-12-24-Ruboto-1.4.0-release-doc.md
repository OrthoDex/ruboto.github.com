Subject: [ANN] Ruboto 1.4.0 released!

The Ruboto team is pleased to announce the release of Ruboto 1.4.0.

Ruboto (JRuby on Android) is a platform for developing full stand-alone
apps for Android using the Ruby language and libraries.  It includes
support libraries and generators for creating projects, classes, tests,
and more.  The complete APIs of Android, Java, and Ruby are available to
you using the Ruby language.

New in version 1.4.0:

This release adds support for JRuby 1.7.22 and improves the installation
of HAXM.  `ruboto setup --update` will now update an existing HAXM
installation if a new version is available for download.
