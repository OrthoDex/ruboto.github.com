# Getting started

## Ruby

* Install ruby or jruby if you don't already have it. JRuby has a very easy
  install process, or you can use rvm

## Ruboto

`gem install ruboto`

## Requirements

* Install the JDK if it's not on your system already
* Install the Android SDK
* Add the sdk to `$ANDROID_HOME` as an absolute path (Java does not expand
  tildes `~`)
* Add the sdk's `tools/` and `platform-tools/` directory to your `$PATH`

## Set Up

You can easily check or install the requirements above: 

`ruboto setup`

## Diving In

* Generate an Emulator image unless you want to develop using your
  phone.
* Read the [README](https://github.com/ruboto/ruboto/blob/master/README.md "README") and 
  [visit the Wiki](https://github.com/ruboto/ruboto/wiki "Wiki")
